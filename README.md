# Carthage (Framework dependencies)
In order to install any framework dependency to the project, [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is used for managing them.

If all you need is to install the required dependencies to run the project, run the following command:

```bash
$ carthage bootstrap
```
